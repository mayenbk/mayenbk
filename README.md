MAYEN BEN-KOKO (SHE/HER) 
Interested in the intersection of AI, Data, and Healthcare Innovation.

With a background in biomedical engineering and healthcare research, I’m passionate about how data and technology can improve lives.

I’m currently learning AI for healthcare and cybersecurity to better understand how digital health data can stay secure as it scales.

I love collaborating on projects that connect tech with impact — particularly in AI for healthcare, data visualization, and digital ethics.
