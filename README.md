MAYEN BEN-KOKO (SHE/HER) 
Interested in the intersection of AI, Data, and Healthcare Innovation.

With a background in biomedical engineering and healthcare research, I’m passionate about how data and technology can improve lives.

I am currently learning AI for healthcare and cybersecurity to better understand how digital health data can stay secure as it scales.
